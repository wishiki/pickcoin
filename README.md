# Pickcoin

Pickcoin is a locative indirect augmented reality web app.

### Overview
***
During the summer of 2016 Japanese artist Inari Wishiki collaborated with a Rotterdam-based ice cream parlour De IJssalon Witte de Withstraat to make the impossible happen.

Inari together with the shop distributed 750 virtual coins all over the streets, covering almost the entire area of Rotterdam city centre to the south of the Erasmus Bridge. Collecting 10 coins was equivalent to 1 scoop of ice cream during the 5 days between 29th August and 2nd September. Coins were only exchangeable for 2 hours a day, namely when Inari was working in the shop.

At the till coins were also purchasable at a staggeringly low price of 10 cent for 10 coins, which you could then drop back into the system. This meant a temporary inifinite supply of free ice cream.


### The web app
***
The web app was a Google Street View with coin graphics superimposed onto it. The streetview shifted itself according to the geolocation of your mobile device and as you moved around, nearby coins appeared on your screen. You could interact with coins  by picking up or dropping.

As soon as you opened up the web app on a browser, a device UUID was automatically generated. This functioned as your wallet and the amount of coins you picked up stayed even if you closed the browser once and reopened the web app.
