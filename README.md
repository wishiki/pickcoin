> Pickcoin is a locative indirect augmented reality web app.

### Overview
___
During the summer of 2016 Japanese artist Inari Wishiki collaborated with a Rotterdam-based ice cream parlour De IJssalon Witte de Withstraat to make the impossible happen.

Inari together with the shop distributed 750 virtual coins all over the streets, covering almost the entire area of Rotterdam city centre to the south of the Erasmus Bridge. Collecting 10 coins was equivalent to 1 scoop of ice cream during the 5 days between 29th August and 2nd September. Coins were only exchangeable for 2 hours a day, namely when Inari was working in the shop.

At the till coins were alse purchasable at a staggeringly low price of 10 cent for 10 coins, with which you could drop back into the system. This meant a temporary inifinite supply of free ice cream.
